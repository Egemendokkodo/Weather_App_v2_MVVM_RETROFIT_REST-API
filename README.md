# Weather_App_v2_MVVM_RETROFIT_REST-API
I created a new weather app using Kotlin's Retrofit library <br>
I also paid attention to the MVVM architecture <br>
You can see the 7 day weather data <br>
You can see the current location's weather by tapping the location icon at the top left corner. <br>
Or you can simply search for the city you want to see the weather for from the search bar.. <br>
